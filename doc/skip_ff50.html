<h1>Skip write to 0xff50 register before leaving boot ROM</h1>
<h2>First attempt</h2>
<p>I tried to reproduce on my DMG-CPU B what Costis did to his Super GameBoy:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~costis/sgb_hack/">https://www.its.caltech.edu/~costis/sgb_hack/</a></p>
<p>I connected my FPGA to pin 74 of the DMG, which I figured out to be the input of the amplifier of
the oscillator circuit. I overclocked all clock ticks of the "<i>LD ($FF00+$50),A</i>" instruction with
24 MHz, each one individually and later all at once in a burst, but I had no success in preventing the
write operation from taking place. In another try I also included the instructions directly before and
after the <i>LD</i>, even went up to 36 MHz. I also tried slower clocks, because I thought, maybe I'm
too fast. But still no success.</p>
<p>Then I was thinking that maybe I'm at the wrong clock pin. Maybe I need to connect to pin 73, the
output of the amplifier. Maybe the GameBoy draws its clock from there and I need to force it onto the
output, because <i>maybe</i> the fast clock pulses get swallowed by the amplifier in between. Oddly, that
worked! Needs to be more than 24 MHz, though. I succeded with 30 and 36 MHz. But it turned out later that
my reasoning and my conclusions where totally wrong. It turned out that the field of the wire I connected
to pin 73 was propagating onto the loose wire I had connected to pin 74. This weak signal was enough for
the GameBoy to get clocked. But it also picked up some additional pulses, which I did not intend, and
therefore my counting was off. It worked, because I didn't overclock the <i>LD</i> instruction, but the
<i>INC HL</i> instead!</p>
<h2>Second attempt</h2>
<p>So I tried the input again (pin 74) and adjusted the offset to still target the increment instruction
and it worked. I was able to pin point it down to one single clock tick within the <i>INC HL</i>
instruction. The first tick of the second machine cycle needs to be overclocked at 30 or 36 MHz:</p>
<p><pre>

             |                                    INC HL                               |
             |        instruction fetch              | additional cycle for 16 bit op. |

</pre></p>
<h2>Trying to make sense of what happens</h2>
<p>The first odd thing that catched my eye was that the second cycle of the increment instruction
fetched some data or instruction from cartridge ROM. It does this only if its first tick is
overclocked. Normally only the first cycle of the 16-bit increment instruction is a fetch. A15
(the ROM chip select) goes low directly after the overclocking. I assume it fetches a NOP
instruction from address 0x1fe. I will explain in a moment how I come to that conclusion. After
the overclocking at exactly this point, the CPU runs through exactly 258 NOPs until it reaches the
entry point of my ROM (0x100). Or more precisely the second instance of the entry point at address
0x300. The test ROM I put into my FPGA is only 512 bytes and since I only connect to A0-A8, it
gets repeated over and over. To verify the value of the PC register, I replaced the usual JP at
address 0x101 with a CALL, so I could read the original PC (+3) from the stack, copy it to address
0x1ff from where my FPGA receives it and displays it on some LEDs. The result was 0x304.</p>
<p>These are the last few instructions of the boot ROM:</p>
<p><pre>
        ; (HL=$0134)
        LD B,$19          ; $00f1
        LD A,B            ; $00f3
Addr_00F4:
        ADD (HL)          ; $00f4
        <font color="green">INC HL</font>            ; $00f5
        DEC B             ; $00f6
        JR NZ, Addr_00F4  ; $00f7
        ADD (HL)          ; $00f9
        JR NZ,$fe         ; $00fa   ; if $19 + bytes from $0134-$014D don't add to $00
                                    ;  ... lock up
        LD A,$01          ; $00fc
        <font color="red">LD ($FF00+$50),A</font>  ; $00fe   ; turn off DMG rom
</pre></p>
<p>Green is the increment that got its second cycle messed up by the fast clock pulse. Red
is the register write where I originally failed.</p>
<p>This is my ROM:</p>

<p>The red byte is the location where the CPU jumps to when overclocking the 16-bit increment.
The first 256 bytes of the ROM are zero. With the two zeros at the bottom, these are the 258 NOPs
until it reaches a 259th NOP at address 0x100/0x300 and the JP.</p>
<p>To verify that it indeed ends up fetching the NOP at address 0x1fe during the second cycle of
the INC HL instruction, I duplicated the jump from the entry point (blue in the dump below) to
address 0x1fe (orange), wrapping around to 0x0:</p>

<p>This actually changed the behaviour, but not as intended. It messed up the jump and ended up
somewhere else. I wasn't able to figure out where. I also tried this:</p>

<p>It somehow ended up in the loop that writes to address 0x1ff, but it skipped the memcpy. TODO: link code here.
I shifted the jump one more byte to the right:</p>

<p>This finally worked, resulting in the diagram below. It seems like the CPU needs two NOPs to recover from the
invalid state inducted by the overclocking. I also noticed, the HL register that was 0x14c before the increment
instruction, wasn't incremented correctly. It contains 0x1ff.</p>
