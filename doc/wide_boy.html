<h1>Wide-Boy64</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I got my hands on a Wide-Boy64 AGB that I found on Ebay. It's in a very good condition.</p>

<p>It came with this small cable. I don't know what this is used for.</p>

<i><u>Picture 2</u> Cable that came with the Wide-Boy64</i></p>
The smaller black connector of this cable fits into the white connector on the front side of the Wide-Boy.
The bigger white connector fits into the connector on a Wide-Boy64 CGB cartridge port adapter that is used to
connect a specially prepped Game Boy Color to a Wide-Boy64 CGB. I bought such an adapter from the same seller
on Ebay from which I got the Wide-Boy64 AGB. Though this adapter obviously can't be used with the AGB version
of the Wide-Boy. I bought it out of curiosity. The Wide-Boy64 AGB that I have doesn't even have the 40 pin
connector that you need for that. The connector is not soldered onto the PCB and there is no hole cut for it
into the front of the shell. I could solder it in myself, but then I would also need to cut a hole for it. I
don't want to modify the original shell. It would look very ugly when <i>I</i> do it.<p>
<p>You can't connect any regular Game Boy to a Wide-Boy. The ones you use as an controller for the Wide-Boy
don't have a Game Boy CPU. They have a different PCB that just connects the cartridge port to the display and
buttons (and maybe the audio amplifier, not sure about that). So they just act as an I/O device.<p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Here is what I found out about the main components inside the Wide-Boy64 AGB. (Higher resolution pictures can
be found in my <a href="../db/wb64agb_iceboy_1.html">Game Boy database</a>.)</p>

<p>The EEPROM in the bottom left (BU9850) is used in many N64 cartridges that allow to save the game. I don't
know what it is used for in the Wide-Boy. My guess is, they designed it in just in case they need it, but then
never used it for anything. The Wide-Boy64 AGB does not save any settings. It doesn't even have a menu or
something. I haven't checked the contents of this EEPROM yet. I expect it to be all 0xFF. Ah, and yes, it is
connected to the N64 connector at the bottom, so it can be accessed by the N64.</p>
<p>There is a second place at the top center of the PCB where a Game Boy External Link Port could be soldered
in. Seems like when the PCB was designed, they haven't decided yet where to put the connector.</p>
<p>Luckily, the CIC, EEPROM and PROM chips are socketed. This makes it easy to change the region and dump the
EEPROM and PROM contents. The Flash is not socketed though. I don't know yet if all it's contents can be
accessed by the N64 or if the FPGA reads some other data than the N64 software from it as well.</p>
<h2>Spartan bitstream</h2>
<p>I was able to dump the FPGA bitstream from the PROM with an iCE40HX-8K Breakout Board.</p>

<p>The code I used for dumping it on a 1MBit UART can be found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/iceboy/reveng/ci/master/tree/wb64agb_prom_dump/dump.sv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The PROM contains 179160 bits (22395 bytes) and when stored LSB-first it has the following hashes:</p>
<ul>
<li>MD5: 536e776798fa2ab103e49cd322fb5669</li>
<li>SHA256: b41f2e84b0d14a2065dfcc17bfb7d49056a277c9c2f0ace1124c7e48b831b49f</li>
</ul>
<h2>CGB Adapter</h2>
<p>This is the CGB Adapter I bought:</p>

<i><u>Picture 7&8</u> Wide-Boy64 CGB Adapter PCB</i></p>
<p>I have drawn a schematic for the PCB: <a href="dmg_cart_probe.pdf">dmg_cart_probe.pdf</a></p>
<p>I labelled the pins on the cartridge connector with the signals that they ususally have on a cartridge
(address, data, ...), not the display and button signals that the Wide-Boy puts onto them. The fact that they
didn't connect pin 31 (the analog pin) makes me think that this PCB wasn't designed specifically for the
Wide-Boy in mind. They might have used this for probing the signals between a Game Boy and a cartridge.
(Notice the silk print on the PCB: "DMG CARTRIDGE PROBE") It wouldn't make any sense to not use pin 31
otherwise.</p>
